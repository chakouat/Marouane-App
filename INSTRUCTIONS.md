# CHARIOHISAB - React Native App Development Instructions

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
This is a React Native application built with TypeScript and Expo SDK 53. The app is a frontend-only application with no backend integration.

## 📋 **Development Rules & Guidelines**

### **Technology Stack**
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **SDK Version**: Expo SDK 53
- **Architecture**: Frontend only (no backend)
- **UI Components**: Custom components based on Figma designs

### **Design Implementation Rules**

#### **1. Figma to Code Conversion**
- Convert Figma designs to React Native components using TypeScript
- Use Locofy generated code as the foundation
- Maintain exact visual fidelity to the original Figma designs
- Preserve all spacing, colors, fonts, and layout specifications

#### **2. Code Standards**
- **No Additions**: Do not add features, components, or functionality not present in the original design
- **Exact Match**: The final result must look identical to the provided screenshots
- **Asset Usage**: Use only the provided assets from the assets folder
- **Error Fixing**: Fix any errors in the Locofy generated code to make it functional

#### **3. Color Palette**
```typescript
// Primary Colors
const COLORS = {
  background: "#FFFAEE",
  primary: "#FFC244",
  secondary: "#000000",
  white: "#FFFFFF",
  border: "#505050",
  text: "#636363",
  placeholder: "#A7A7A7",
  accent: "#C58400"
};
```

#### **4. File Structure**
```
src/
├── screens/          // Main screen components
├── components/       // Reusable UI components
├── assets/          // SVG, PNG, and other media files
├── types/           // TypeScript type definitions
└── App.tsx          // Main application entry point
```

#### **5. Component Development**
- Each screen should be a separate component in the `screens/` folder
- Reusable components go in the `components/` folder
- Use the exact styles provided by Locofy
- Maintain proper TypeScript typing
- Implement proper safe area handling

#### **6. Asset Management**
- All assets must be placed in the `assets/` folder
- Use SVG format for icons and vector graphics
- Maintain original asset names from Figma
- Import assets as React components using react-native-svg

#### **7. Responsive Design**
- Follow the exact dimensions from Figma
- Use proper flex layouts as generated by Locofy
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment
- Ensure proper safe area handling on all devices

### **Testing & Quality Assurance**

#### **Visual Verification**
- Compare final output with provided screenshots
- Ensure pixel-perfect implementation
- Verify all colors match the design system
- Check font sizes and spacing accuracy

#### **Code Quality**
- Fix all TypeScript errors
- Ensure all imports are correctly resolved
- Maintain clean, readable code structure
- Follow React Native best practices

### **Prohibited Actions**
- ❌ Do not add functionality not present in the design
- ❌ Do not modify colors, fonts, or spacing without explicit instruction
- ❌ Do not add backend integration or API calls
- ❌ Do not change the overall layout structure
- ❌ Do not add navigation unless specifically designed in Figma

### **Required Actions**
- ✅ Fix any errors in the provided Locofy code
- ✅ Ensure all assets are properly imported and displayed
- ✅ Maintain exact visual fidelity to Figma designs
- ✅ Implement proper TypeScript typing
- ✅ Test on both iOS and Android platforms
- ✅ Ensure proper safe area handling

## 🚀 **Deployment**
- The app should run successfully on Expo development server
- Support both iOS and Android platforms
- Maintain compatibility with Expo SDK 53
- Ensure web compatibility for testing purposes

## 📝 **Notes**
- This is a frontend-only application
- All data should be static or mocked
- Focus on visual implementation rather than functionality
- Prioritize design accuracy over feature completeness
